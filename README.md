# RUBYPRACTICE

### My journey with Ruby

```ruby
puts "'Hello, World!'"
```
or

```ruby
class HelloWorld
  def def initialize(name)
    @name = name.capitalize
  end
  def sayHi
    puts "Hello #{name}!"
  end
end

hello = HelloWorld.new("World")
hello.sayHi
```

##Just some notes

* Want an input filed for user to put the sentences to change into ceaser_cipher

* TicTacToe is not letting the cpu win only wins if board is full which equals a draw of the user somehow wins.

* ex43 is a space adventure game. Needs a bunch of work to go through the next scene. But it's funny so there that.
