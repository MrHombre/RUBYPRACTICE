# RUBYPRACTICE

##Just some notes

* Want an imput filed for user to put the sentences to change into ceaser_cipher

* TicTacToe is not letting the cpu win only wins if board is full which equals a draw of the user somehow wins.

* ex43 is a space adventure game. Needs a bunch of work to go through the next scene. But it's funny so there that.
